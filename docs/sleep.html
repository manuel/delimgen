 * The most simple example: a single generator that runs an infinite loop
 * that prints something and then sleeps.
 *
 * It demonstrates the core features of the API:
 *
 * - All code is written as `function*` generator functions.
 *
 * - All calls to generators are performed with `yield*`.
 *
 * - All generators are wrapped in a call to the `run` API function.
 *
 * - To kickstart a generator from a non-generator function like
 *   `window.onload`, use `next`.
