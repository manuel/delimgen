# Delimited Generators - Minimal Delimited Control for JS

## Overview

This library implements delimited control operators as a very thin (50
LOC) layer over plain ES6 generators.

It doesn't add any expressive power over plain generators, but I think
it offers a more intuitive API.  Specifically, tasks like waiting for
a promise to settle, spawning a new independent generator, or
implementing a blocking event loop become straightforward.

With a small constant overhead (having to use `function*`, using
`yield*` for every blocking call, and using `next()` to kickstart
generators from an ordinary, non-generator function), one can write
asynchronous JS programs in a quasi-direct style.

## Notes

In terms of delimited control, this library implements single-prompt
continuations that can only be resumed once (this is a fundamental
limitation of generators, but personally I haven't needed
multiply-resumable continuations yet).

Multiple prompts could be added quite easily I think, but I haven't
really needed those either, yet.

The API functions `run`, `suspend`, and `resume` roughly correspond to
`push_prompt`, `take_subcont`, and `push_delim_subcont`, respectively,
